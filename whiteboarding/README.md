### Platforms to use during whiteboarding

In order to be ready for interviews, we recommend that you practice whiteboarding on these tools: 

1. LiveShare on VSCode
2. codeshare.io
    * Click on `Share Code Now`
    * Click on `Share` at the top right of your screen - Here, you have the option to turn `View only` mode on so that your pair can fully play the role of the navigator
    * Share the link given to you with your pair
    * Start coding ! 
3. Google Docs 

Every four weeks, you will practice whiteboarding using one of these tools. We recommend you start with LiveShare first, then codeshare.io, and then Google Docs. The reasoning behind this order is that we want you to use the easiest tool first.


Practicing on different plateforms will allow you to spend your technical interview focusing on communicating and solving the algorithm rather than becoming familiar with a new tool.
