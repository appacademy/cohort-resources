### Platforms to use during whiteboarding

## If you are still in foundations, please open leetcode.md and work on algorithms related to the day you are in. Feel free to solve these on VS Code and then paste them to Leetcode to check your solution.
## If you are past foundations, please read on:

In order to be ready for interviews, we recommend that you practice whiteboarding on these tools: 

1. codeshare.io
    * Click on `Share Code Now`
    * Click on `Share` at the top right of your screen - Here, you have the option to turn `View only` mode on so that your pair can fully play the role of the navigator
    * Share the link given to you with your pair
    * Start coding ! 
2. Google Docs 

You will practice whiteboarding using codeshare.io during the first four weeks and Google Docs during the following weeks. This way, you will use the easiest tool first and you won't feel overwhelmed.


Practicing on different plateforms will allow you to spend your technical interview focusing on communicating and solving the algorithm rather than becoming familiar with a new tool.
