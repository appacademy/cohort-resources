## Logistics - Plagiarism 
* We at App Academy take plagiarism very seriously.
* Don't make the mistake - any infraction of this policy will result in
immediate dismissal.

1. Don’t copy: There's a huge
difference from referencing and learning from the projects of your
predecessors, and just blatantly not writing files of code.
2. Attribute
3. If you’re unsure, ask ahead of time.
