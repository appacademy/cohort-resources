## Why a JS Project?

+ JavaScript is the most universal tool in tech today
+ It's the perfect opportunity to dive deeper into vanilla JS while also choosing one or two libraries to add to your repertoire
+ You can make it look pretty (and recruiters can be very superficial)
+ It complements your FSP and MERN project and completes your portfolio

## JS Project Requirements

+ No unjustified use of libraries 
	+ Do your research and ask if you have any questions
+ Can be a game

	+ `D3.js` is a great library for these type of projects
+ Should have an appropriate scope
+ Must show off front-end skills
	+ Make it pretty!
+ Must show off JS skills -- make it interactive
	+ Make it interactive!
