### MVP List
+ The order you plan on implementing your features 
  - with detailed sub-points!
+ Include expected time to implement. 
  - Be generous with the time estimates!
+ One feature must be a full CRUD cycle
+ 2 days for major features (posts, comments, users, etc)
+ 1 day for minor features (likes, follows, profiles, etc)
+ Include bonus (stretch) features that you will implement given enough time
