### Logistics and Expectations
---

#### Daily Projects

+ Work on the phases in order
  + Always read the instructions for a phase all the way through before starting the project. Best to read them the night before.
+ Make sure you understand every single line of code that you write.
  + If you or your partner writes a line you do not understand, stop and try to understand it.
  + If you need to, ask a question!
  
---
#### Daily Projects

+ It is more important to understand than to race to finish.
  + The projects are designed to keep thinking, building, and problem solving.  They are not necessarily designed to be finished in a day.  
  + As long as you understand every line of code you write, and you can confidently go through the learning objectives of the day, you will have accomplished everything you need each day at App Academy. 

---

#### Assessments

+ Academic Integrity
  + No notes
  + No copying
  + No sharing of assessments
  + No discussion with others during assessment
  + No Github Copilot
+ Violations will result in dismissal

---
#### Assessments
##### Remote
  + Assessments will be administered through Progress Tracker. 
  + For remote assessments, each student will have their own zoom breakout room where they will screenshare. Only one screen is allowed.
  + You must share your screen during these assessments; not doing so will result in a fail and dismissal.
  + Instructors will proctor rmote assessments by moving between breakout monitoring assessment progress and to ensuring academic integrity.
  
---
#### Assessments
##### In Person
+ For in-person assessments, all the same rules apply.  Instead of proctoring via zoom, instructors will be on the classroom floor doing the same monitoring.
+ All assessments are timed.  At the end of the alloted time, assessments will be submitted to the progress tracker for grading.
---

#### Foundations Assessments

+ There are two: W2D1 and W3D1
+ Failing either assessment will result in _deferral_ to the next cohort
+ We want to make sure you are ready before continuing to Week 3

---

#### Core Curriculum Assessments

+ There are 6 Assessments: A01 - A06
+ No consequences for failing one assessment
+ Retake if you fail a second assessment
  + One retake per person
  + The retake is given on same day
  + It is a different version of the assessment
+ Failing the retake will result in _dismissal_
+ If you pass a retake, you stay in the course.  If you fail one more additional assessment you will be dissmissed from the course.

---

#### Assessment Advice
+ Assessments are learning tools
  + Assessments are used to confirm and solidify understanding.
  + Spaced retrieval and testing are proven to aid in learning.
  + Assessments are also check points.  They confirm that you are keeping pace with the material and it makes sense for you to continue on in the course.
+ The material covered each day builds on the last
+ Everybody can score 100%
+ If you find a bug: relax, breath deep, and read the error message
+ Read the spec files

---

#### Tips For Success at a/A

+ Be present & punctual
+ Complete your work to the best of your ability
+ Complete your homework, readings, and videos every night before the next day.
  + App Academy is a fast paced course with very specific amounts of time allotted for each day.  
  + Homework, videos, and readings make up a full third of your time with each day's concepts and material.
  + If you do not do these assignments, you're robbing yourself of 33% of your learning, and setting yourself back for the other 66% because you'll have to spend the day catching up.  
  + Stay on top of the homework and you will set yourself up for success.
  
---
#### Tips For Success at a/A

+ Prioritize understanding over completion for the daily projects
+ Ask for help when you need it
+ Focus full-time on App Academy
  + App Academy is a huge commitment, but in the grand scheme of things 16 weeks is not a huge amount of time.
  + If you invest the time now and commit 100% to App Academy, you will see it payoff huge as a great career as a software engineer.

---

#### Growing As a Developer

+ Collaborate: 
  +Talk to one another - speak code!
+ The best thing you can learn is how to be independent
  + how to read error messages
  + how to debug and use the stack trace
  + how to utilize Google and Stack Overflow
  
---

#### Use of tools

+ ChatGPT is a great tool. However, you must be familiar with the language/library you are asking questions about. Otherwise, you will not be able to filter the response of the AI. 
+ Github Copilot is not allowed. We have seen negative impact on students' learning. It is a great tool post graduation, but not during projects. 
+ Our goal is for you to become a master of your craft, relying on such tools while learning will only affect your progress.
---

#### Code of Conduct

_**NB:**_ Show the Code of Conduct in open.appacademy.io.

+ Demonstrate Integrity in your Work
+ Practice Respect for Others

**If you experience a code of conduct violation**

+ Hold Your Peers Accountable
  + Report it through Progress Tracker
  + Approach an instructor
  + File an annonymous report: [http://report.appacademy.io](http://report.appacademy.io)

---

#### Strike Policy

+ Accountability system
+ 10 Strikes
+ They cannot be removed, with the exception of sick days

  + Morning: by 9am
  + After Lunch: by 1:30pm
  + After Afternoon Break: by 4pm
+ Progress Tracker Reports
+ Absences
+ Devices Out
+ At the discretion of instructors

---

#### Sick Policy

+ Inform us before class
+ Expected to make up the work
+ Strikes in this case can be removed if the work is submitted before next day

+ Verbal attendance check at 9am every day while remote

---

#### Evening Work

+ Review project solutions
+ Do homework in the alloted time
+ Look ahead at the project for the next day
	+ Do **not** start working on it
+ Finish the day's project **only** if you have extra time
+ **Complete Progress Tracker Report before 9am**

---

### Pair Programming
---

+ Come up with the high level plan together
+ **Navigator**: keeps an eye on the plan
+ **Driver**: executes the plan
+ Switch every 15 min
+ Every error/bug is a learning opportunity; don't waste it!
+ Professionalism

---

#### Pair Programming (continued)

+ If you're stuck...
	1) Talk it out with your partner
	2) Test a few ideas with code
	3) Google the error in multiple ways
	4) Call an instructor
+ Remember that it's not a race

---

#### Asking a Question

+ On Progress Tracker, there will be a button "Ask a Question"
+ We will get notified, and head to your breakout room

---

#### Instructor Q & A

---

+ How to start a liveshare
+ How to troubleshoot terminal not being shareable

---

### Final Notes

+ We are here to be software developers
+ Sleep!
+ For today, start on Homework section for the next 1hr20min (approx. estimate for completion)
+ Computer Issues
+ Give instructor email.
