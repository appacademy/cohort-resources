# CREPE

Note:
Here is an acronym to remember some basic steps for approaching an interview coding question.
Clarify the question, come up with a Roadmap, Execute code, Prove that it works, and optimize for Efficiency

---

## C - Clarify the question

* Don't make any assumptions, ask the interviewer
* Find out what the inputs/test cases are
* Write keywords and test cases on the left side of the board

Note:
* This is your chance to start a dialog with the interviewer, a quiet whiteboarding session feels tense and awkward. You've likely already passed a coding challenge to get to this stage, they also want to see if they can work with you.
* Writing keywords and test cases on the board serves as a good reference for when you're writing code later
* In an online interview, you'll want to type out your test cases above your code.

## R - come up with a Roadmap

* Lay out your plan for solving the algorithm
* Use the whiteboard!

Note:
* While you've been going over the question and going over test cases, you should have been mentally coming up with your plan. This part of the interview is a continuation of your conversation.
* Even if you still have to think a bit to come up with a plan, still try and explain some of your thought process. The difference between them asking a question, dead silence, and then you coding on the board is night and day.
* Again, use the whiteboard! On the left side, draw the datatype, use arrows, find any way to visually and verbally explain what you're about to do.
* In an online interview, you may not have a chance to draw out anything, but you'll still want to talk through your plan.

## E - Execute code

* Draw a line separating the left side
* Write legibly, with space between lines
* Talk as you go

Note:
* Utilize you space on the whiteboard, separate what you've been writing with your actual code, leave spaces between lines in case you need to correct or add anything. This is not VSCode.
* It's ok to have small silences, but in general it's nice to let them know what you're doing line-by-line.
* In an online interview, the text editor will make this easier since you dont have to worry about writing legibly, but the tips about talking still apply

---

## P - Prove that it works

* In another color, walk through a test case

Note:
* In an online interview, you would do this using comments next to your code

---

## E - optimize for Efficiency

* Check your code for time optimization

Note:
* Hopefully, from talking through your algorithm earlier as part of the roadmap step, they haven't let you code out an inefficient algo. Either way you should be able to explain what the Big O is and why.

## Pairboarding

* Interviewer
  * What is the applicant's thought process?
  * It's ok to guide and give hints
  * Provide feedback!
* Applicant
  * CREPE
  * Remember that this is practice!
