# Whiteboarding

---

## Volunteer?

---

# CREPE

Note:
Clarify the question, come up with a Roadmap, Execute code, Prove that it works, optimize for Efficiency

---

## C - Clarify the question

* Don't make any assumptions, ask the interviewer
* Find out what the inputs/test cases are
* Write keywords and/or test cases under the prompt

Note:
* This is your chance to start a dialog with the interviewer, a quiet whiteboarding session feels tense and awkward. You've likely already passed a coding challenge to get to this stage, they just want to see if they can work with you.
* Writing keywords and test cases on the board serves as a good reference for when you're writing code later

---

## R - come up with a Roadmap

* Lay out your plan for solving the algorithm
* Use the whiteboard!

Note:
* While you've been going over the question and going over test cases, you should have been mentally coming up with your plan. This part of the interview is a continuation of your conversation.
* Even if you still have to think a bit to come up with a plan, still try and explain some of your thought process. The difference between them asking a question, dead silence, and then you coding on the board is night and day.
* Again, use the whiteboard! On the left side, draw the datatype, use arrows, find any way to visually and verbally explain what you're about to do.

---

## E - Execute code

* Draw a line separating the left side
* Write legibly, with space between lines
* Talk as you go

Note:
* Utilize you space on the whiteboard, separate what you've been writing with your actual code, leave spaces between lines in case you need to correct or add anything. This is not VSCode.
* It's ok to have small silences, but in general it's nice to let them know what you're doing line-by-line.

---

## P - Prove that it works

* walk through a test case

---

## E - optimize for Efficiency

* Check your code for time optimization

## Pairboarding

* Interviewer
  * What is the applicant's thought process?
  * It's ok to guide and give hints
  * Provide feedback!
* Applicant
  * CREPE
  * Remember that this is practice!


Note:
* Students should be pairboarding as the interviewer/applicant relationship
* Interviewer should be supportive and engaged, but don't do the problem for them
* Remember that this is practice, it's not about being right or wrong. We're all here to level up our skills, one of the ways we compete against CS degrees is our ability to communicate effectively. Being comfortable with whiteboarding, yes, will help with interviewing but it also helps us in our general ability to communicate in different ways.
