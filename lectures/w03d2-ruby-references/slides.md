Note:

+ No need to go into any more details than the slide contents.
+ If you (the instructor) has questions, feel free to reach out to George Feng
+ If students have questions, point them to the website url above
+ This slide should be in for both cities
+ We need to announce it here (first in-person welcome lecture)
+ And announce it at the start of job search, which will be W13D1

# SF SPECIFIC ENDING

Note:
The remaining slides are all SF specific.

## References & Scope

---

## Today's Learning Objectives

- Describe the differences between variables/references and actual Ruby objects
- Identify whether an operation mutates an object or reassigns a variable reference
- Given a code snippet, determine which variables are in scope in each section
- With regards to scope, explain the different implications of opening up a block vs a method definition
- Properly initialize a `Hash` and `Array` with default values

---

## What we WON'T be covering
- Memory allocation/management in Ruby (beyond basics of Object ID)
- Garbage collection

---

## References in Ruby

---

### Variables

+ Ruby variables hold *references* (otherwise known as *pointers*) to objects stored in memory
+ `=` assignment operator
  + _assigns_ the variable pointer
  + doesn't change or *mutate* the object stored in memory

---

### Mutability

+ Mutable: state can be modified after it is created
+ Immutable: state cannot be modified after it is created

| Mutable  | Immutable   |
|----------|-------------|
| `String` | `Integer`   |
| `Array`  | `Float`     |
| `Hash`   | `Symbol`    |

---

### Reference Diagram + Demo

### What's the difference

* `<<`
* `concat`
* `+=`

# Scope

---

## Different kinds of variables
* **Local variables**
* Global Variables
* Instance variables
* Class Variables

---

### Block Scoping (of local variables)
* Inside of a `do..end` block, you have access to all variables declared previously (higher) in your code and at the same or an outer-level scope.
* Variables *declared* within a block, are not accessible to the outer scope
  * However, if a variable is declared in outer-level scope, *changes* made to variable in inner-level scope persist when back at outer-level.

---

## Examples

---

```rb
x = 2

3.times do
  x *= 2
end

puts x
```

---

```rb
3.times do
  x = 2
end

puts x
```

---

### Scope "Gates"
Parts of Ruby code in which an *entirely* new scope is created and all local variables previously defined are no longer accessible (i.e. you do not have access to local variables defined in outer scopes). The three main scope gates are:
1. Method definitions
2. Class definitions
3. Module definitions

---

## Examples

---

```rb
x = 10

def some_method
  puts x
end

some_method
```

---

## Parameters vs Arguments

* **Parameter** - variable in a method _definition_
* **Argument** - variable method is _invoked_ with

---

## Passing arguments to methods

* In the scope of a method, the parameter is a copy of the argument that the method was invoked with - both are references
  * In essence another reference is created, that points to the same spot in memory as the argument passed in
* Therefore if we _reassign_ the parameter within the method, the argument that the method was invoked with is unaffected
* But if we _mutate_ the parameter within the method, this affects the argument the method was invoked with (since it is pointing to the same object)

---

### What do you think this code will output?

```rb
def inc(num)
  num += 1
end

a = 1
inc(a)

puts a
```

---

### How about this?

```rb
def add_square(arr, num)
  arr << (num ** 2)
end

squares = [1, 4, 9]
add_square(squares, 4)

p squares
```

## Array/Hash Defaults

---

## Making Array of Arrays

* Naive Approach: `Array.new(3, [])`
* Correct Approach(es): `Array.new(3) { [] }` || `Array.new(3) { Array.new }`

---

## Making Hash with Array default

* Naive Approach 1: `Hash.new([])`: The default could be mutated!
* Naive Approach 2: `Hash.new { [] }`: does not store keys into the hash!
* Correct Approach: `Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = [] }`

---

## Creating a Counter Hash
* `Hash.new(0)`: works fine because we can't mutate Integers
