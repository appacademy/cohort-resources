## Strategies for Maximizing Test Performance

---

## Learning Objectives

- Be able to recognize common stressors that students face during this program
- Be aware of the strategies and tools available to manage these stressors in a healthy way
- Build a game plan for how you will handle assessments

---

## Agenda

+ Factors that decrease test performance
+ Discuss findings of alumni survey:
	+ What you may experience
		- Why do we experience these things?
	+ What you can do about it!
+ Additional resources

Note: Remind them that everyone has different life experiences! For some people, this program will be the hardest thing they have ever done. For others, they will feel exactly in their element and feel very little stress. The items that we discuss or may not apply to you, just be aware that they could.
---

## Factors That Decrease Test Performance 

+ How well you know the content and prepare for the test taking situation
+ Your thoughts and attitudes about the test
	+  "I hate tests"/"I'm a bad test-taker" vs. "I may not get a perfect score, but I know what to expect and I know I can pass!"
+ Your level of stress and ability to manage anxiety

Note: some degree of stress actually improves performance, but too much will negatively impact it. The trick is to find out what is optimal for you.

## Alumni Survey Results: What You May Experience

+ Struggling to get enough sleep, nutrition, water, and/or exercise
+ Imposter Syndrome
+ Fear of what may happen if you fail out
+ During assessments, some may have a physical response as well as mental
  - heart pounding
  - extreme sweating
  - trouble focusing
  - blacking out for a few seconds
  - shakiness

---

## Why do we experience these things?

+ natural human response to risk
	+ changing careers
  + financial risk
  + various life changes
+ your mind is being challenged (this is a difficult course!)
+ extreme growth in a short amount of time can be painful

Note: the main things to stress is that these reactions are NORMAL! students with passing grades have quit just because they think they can't handle it. We want to avoid this, so remind them that struggling is normal and that there is nothing wrong with feeling scared or anxious.

## Scientifically Proven Strategies

+ Using breathing, relaxation, and positive self-talk to keep yourself calm before a test. 
+ Planning and utilizing test-taking strategies (instead of winging it).
+ Getting enough sleep.
+ Studying with other students.

## Top Strategies from aA Grads

Note: we surveyed ~150 aA grads on how they handled stress during the cohort, both in general and specifically regarding assessments. We asked them what were the most effective strategies they used, and here are our findings ordered by how often they appeared.

Preface the strategies by telling them that not all of these methods may work for you! give them an example.

## Top Strategies from aA Grads

+ Studying
  + this was the top method of relieving assessment anxiety
  + specifically, find your knowledge gaps and focus on those areas
+ Practice Assessments
  + simulate a stressful environment when practicing
  	+ visible timers (set for half the alotted time)
    + loud/obnoxious music
    + unfamiliar environment

---

## Top Strategies from aA Grads

+ Outcome acceptance
  + fear of the unknown is a big cause of anxiety
  + force yourself to think through what will happen if you do fail
+ Positive self-talk
  + if you made it into the program, you are good enough to be here
  + focus on one small problem at a time instead of worrying about the bigger picture
  + the overwhelming majority of students DO pass each exam – you’ve got this!

---

## Top Strategies from aA Grads

+ Positive debugging
  + if you think of bugs as "mistakes", you will panic when you hit one
  + if you accept that bugs are normal and have a plan for how to debug, then your brain is much more likely to stay calm
  + practice debugging before the assessment!
  + share buggy versions of assessments with friends

---

## Top Strategies from aA Grads

+ Breaks
  + take 5-min breaks whenever you are stuck or your brain is melting
  + on the assessment, take a 60-90 second break for water if you are panicking
  + build longer breaks into your weekly schedule that give you permission to rest
+ Breathing
	+ take slow, deep breaths (inhale 6 seconds, exhale 6 seconds)
  + many students found helpful before and during assessments

---

## Top Strategies from aA Grads

+ Community
	+ studying alone breeds fear that you are behind everyone else
  + realizing that others are struggling as well will give you a boost of confidence
  + study in groups, quiz each other, etc.
  + ask TAs for advice and encouragement
  + less isolation -> less anxiety -> higher performance
  
Note: !important!
During the first couple of weeks, there is a wide range of student expertise. Working together could potentially cause more discouragement if students who are new to coding begin studying with students who have a strong CS background. Remind them that they should NOT compare themselves to anyone with prior coding experience!

---

## Top Strategies from aA Grads

+ routine (patterns help the brain stay calm!)
+ exercise
+ sleep (backed by many scientific studies)
+ drinking lots of water
+ listen to music (while studying, during assessment, etc.)
+ meditation
+ prayer
+ sunshine (spend time outside!)

Note: these strategies showed up less often, but still frequently

## What you can do about it!

> We just dumped a lot of strategies on you! 

> Each individual should test different ones out to see what is most effective for them.

> The main idea is to be _intentional_ - don't just ride the wave of emotion.

> Have a game plan, and if it isn't working, make adjustments!
