* Frontend routes are completely separate from backend routes. These are the components that will be displayed. 

* Ask the students to think about how the page will be organized when deciding which frontend routes they will need. Feel free to tell them to reference Pokedex or BenchBNB. 

* No need to take a deep dive on github issues- those details can get covered in the first standup. Just let them know that we will be using github issues are a means of communication.
