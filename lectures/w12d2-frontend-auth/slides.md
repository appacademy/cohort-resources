## Session Based Authentication

1. You attempt to log in using your credentials.
1. Your login credentials are verified, and the server creates a session with a session ID for you. This session is stored in the database.
1. Your session ID is stored in your browser (client) as a cookie.
1. Upon subsequent requests, your cookie is verified against the session ID stored in the server. If itâ€™s a match, the request is considered valid and processed.
1. If you log out of an application, the session ID is destroyed on both the client and server sides.
