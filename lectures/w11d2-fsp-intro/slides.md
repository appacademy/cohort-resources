# W11D1: Full Stack Project Intro

---

## The Job Search Isn't That Far Away
* Less structured
* More individual responsibility and ownership
* Three complete portfolio projects

---

## Main Points
1. What is the FSP?
2. Goals
3. Recipe for Success
4. Examples
5. Logistics 
6. Git Workflow
7. Next Steps

---

## What is it?
1. "Pixel perfect" clone
2. SPA App (React/Redux + RoR)
3. Centerpiece of portfolio
4. Important learning experience

---

## FullStack Clone
- Either:
	1. one of our approved apps, or
  2. some ecommerce website
  3. A website not on our list, but meets our requirements
  
- To meet our requirements for approval an app must have:
	- at least 1 full CRUD feature, but ideally > 2
  - the CRUD feature should be integral to the app

---
## Tips for deciding your project
- What websites do you like using?
- What technologies are you interested in?
	- AWS image/video/music storage
  - Websockets live chat
- Is it a good looking website?

---
## Development Process
- In two weeks your goal is to complete:
	- User Auth
	- Getting your app on Production
	- 4 other features (hopefully)
	- Production README

---

## Goals
1. Create thorough set of design documents
2. Build something that looks good and functions well 
3. Review and internalize important curriculum concepts
4. Finish as many features as possible

---

## Recipe for Success
1. Set a realistic scope
2. Prioritize clean, polished, functionality
3. Work on one feature at a time
4. Embrace the learning opportunity
5. Focus on the curriculum first

---

## Common Pitfalls 
1. Put off working on important features
2. Don't listen to your Project Advisor's advice
3. Use an inappropriate or unprofessional theme
4. Try to be too original
5. Underestimate the time it takes to style and/or create seeds
6. Think that design documents aren't important

## Logistics - Plagiarism 
* We take plagiarism very seriously
* Infractions will result in dismissal from the program

	1. Don't copy: There's a huge difference between referencing and learning from the projects of your predecessors, and just blatantly copying their work
	2. Attribute
	3. Ask

---

## Logistics - TAs to PAs 
+ Each of you will be assigned a Project Advisor (PA)
+ Your PA will:
	+ regularly review your progress
  + offer guidance and answer questions
  + help hold you accountable to deadlines
  + encourage independent bug hunting

## Logistics - Features

1. Production version is deployed and hosted
2. Allows new account creation, login, and demo login (User Auth)
3. Production README
4. Minimum of four (4) additional features
   - Satisfactory styling
   - Smooth, bug-free navigation
   - Adequate seed data

---

## Project Completion and Expectations

- At a minimum you should complete 60% of your FSP by the end of the two weeks
  - A complete and styled; User Auth, Feature 1 and Feature 2
  - Successful hosting of your website
  - A complete Production README
- Anything you do not complete will need to be completed before you are approved to start your job search
- You should aim for 100% completion

---

## Logistics - Project Quality
1. "Pixel Perfect" clone
	- Layout
	- Behavior / Interactions
2. Fully functional
3. Error/Bug free (including the console)
4. Sufficient, appropriate seed data
5. Free of dead links or extranneous content

## Logistics - [Scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mpc1eArqplVtNakIcgSFHGGEKbFCiRTnOc7d2QUGwW0/edit#gid=1764138542)

* Same one you used for your JSP - no need to create another

---

## Git Workflow
+ Utilize git and [feature branching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
	- Your `main` branch will always be clean and error free
  - Create a new branch whenever you start working on a new feature
  - Do all your development work on the feature branch and only merge it into the `main` branch when it is functional and complete
  - Push the updated `main` branch up to Production
