51
  + the whole box model as described above applies to block boxes
52
+ inline: opposite of block, flows with the document's text, appearing on the same line as surrounding text and other inline elements
53
+ inline-block: mix of the other two, flows with surrounding text/inline elements, can still be sized using width and height, wont be broken across paragraph lines,

Grid
CSS Grid is a versatile and powerful tool for creating responsive and complex web layouts.

CSS Grid is a layout system used to create grid layouts in web design. It operates within a grid container, which can be any HTML element (e.g., <div>)

display: grid;

Grid v.s. Flex
Grid is a 2 dimensional layout model where Flex is one dimensional

Both Css Grid and Flex are properties placed on the parent container.

CSS Grid: Supports both row-based and column-based layouts simultaneously. You can create grids that have rows and columns in any arrangement.

CSS Flexbox: Primarily used for laying out items along a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.
