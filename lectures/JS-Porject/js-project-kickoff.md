### Why a JS Project?

- Almost every employer uses JavaScript in some form
- An opportunity to extend your JS knowledge and explore some    great libraries
- You can make something really pretty with JS/CSS (recruiters love pretty stuff!)
- Supplements your FSP and MERN as another coding example

---

### Backend?

- If you are using an external API, sometimes these APIs are not accessible from a browser (CORS-enabled)
- You will need to set up a small backend to reroute your API calls and serve your project. 
- Backend skeleton is on [AAO](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/swe-campus-hybrid/javascript-project/server-setup)

### Asking Questions 

- We will be using a question queue instead of PT to ask bug related questions
- If you have a conceptual or high level questions about design or emplimentation reach out to your project advisor via slack and they will work one on one with you.

### The Questions Queue
- How to ask a question in the question queue (cohort slack channel 2021-10-25):
  1. Provide a description of the bug/error and when it happens/how you produced it.
  2. Share Screenshots of your source code (with line numbers), console errors (the whole error), and (if applicable) whatever is rendering wrong.
  3. Tell us what you've tried and Googled in attempt to resolve the issue.
  4. When resolved, edit the post to indicate the issue is Resolved and share the solution/cause of the issue.
