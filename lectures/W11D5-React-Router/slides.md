## React Router

---

### Learning Objectives

+ Why we use React Router
+ Learn how to use React Router to render different components
+ Learn that frontend routes !== backend routes

---

### Single Page Applications

+ React is popular for single page applications (SPAs) because only required or updated components are rendered.

+ Oftentimes in SPAs, the HTML is only served up once from the server unlike multiple page applications (MPAs).
	+ There is no page reload when content on the page changes. 

---

### Frontend Routes !== Backend Routes

+ Using React, we will only make one request at the beginning of the session - or upon refresh - to the server to get actual HTML

  + Which route is that?

---

### Answer:

+ With React, the only backend route that will actually serve up HTML
from now on is the root route: `/`

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root to: 'static_pages#root'
end
```

+ We will still use other backend routes from Rails in our app for API
calls to get data from our databse, but not to get HTML.

---

### The Illusion of Navigation

+ On the frontend, React is able to render different components but the url will always be the root path '/'

+ We still want to mimic the behavior of navigating a multi-page site,
by changing the URL when content changes

  + Why do we want to do this?

---

### React Router Basics

+ React Router is the defacto routing library for React

+ Three primary components in React Router:
	+ router <HashRouter>
  + route matchers <Route> and <Switch>
  + navigation <Link>, <NavLink>, <Redirect>

+ All imported from `react-router-dom`

---

## Getting started

+ NPM install react-router
+ NPM install react-router-dom

+ <HashRouter> Example: "www.mywebsite.com/#/person/john"
  - server will get "www.mywebsite.com/"
  - react router will read "/person/john"

```jsx
// Other imports omitted for brevity
import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

const Root = ({ store }) => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <HashRouter>
      <App />
    </HashRouter>
  </Provider>
);

```

---

### <Route>
```jsx
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
//define routes inside of render or return
  <Route path="/" component={Home} />
  <Route path="/todos" component={TodoIndexContainer} />
  <Route path="/todos/new" component={TodoFormContainer} />
```

+ Used to determine which components to render at which routes
  
+ A Route component ALWAYS renders to the virtual DOM
  + But when the path does not match, it will render `null`
  
+ Should always start with `/`

---

### Props a <Route> Accepts

+ `path`: the path to match against
+ `component`: takes a React component
+ `render`: takes an inline function
+ `exact`: ensures the path is an exact match
  + If any path is matched completely - regardless of additional characters in the URL, the component will render


```jsx
<Route path="/todos" component={TodoIndexContainer} />
<Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
<Route exact path="/" render={() => <h1>Home</h1>} />
```
Let's add some routes to our website!

---

### <Switch>

+ Renders only the first matching route
  
+ Beware of ordering!
  
+ Good to have a catch-all ('/') route as the last nested route

```html
<Switch>
  <Route path="/todos/new" component={TodoFormContainer}/>
  <Route path="/todos" component={TodoIndexContainer}/>
  <Route path="/" component={Home}/>
</Switch>
```

### <Link>

+ `to` property takes in a string representing the path to link to
  
+ Generates an anchor tag in your HTML document to a specific route

```jsx
<Link to="/todos">All Todos</Link>

// <a href="/todos">All Todos</a> renders to your HTML
```

---

### <NavLink>

+ Built on top of <Link>
+ Adds `active` styling on the current link

```jsx
<NavLink
  exact={true}
  to="/users"
  activeClassName="selected"
  activeStyle={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}
>Users</NavLink>
```

### Props a <Route> Passes

+ `match` 
  + Represents how a route matched the current url. Includes the following properties: `params`, `isExact`, `path`, `url`
  + Accessed in Route component as _this.props.match_.
+ `location`
  + Immutable JavaScript object that represents url's current state
  + Accesssed in Route component as _this.props.location_.
+ `history`
  + Keeps track of our hash routes and allows us to change it
  + Includes methods such as: `push`, `replace`
  
---

### ownProps

+ In redux, containers are themselves components, so they receive props from parent components
 + We refer to them as `ownProps`
  
+ Their props are passed as an argument to mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps
  
+ `ownProps` will *also* be passed down to the connected component

Let's look at an example.

---

### match.params

+ use match.params to access `:id` wildcards in our url

```js
// TodoShowContainer /todos/2
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  todo: state.todos[ownProps.match.params.id]
});

```

1. Let's add a route for our `TodoShowContainer`
2. Let's look at how the `:id` is getting passed down to the `TodoShowContainer` in ownProps

---

### ownProps/match.params Demo

---

### withRouter

+ *function* available from react router

+ Provides Router props (match, location, history) to components NOT rendered by a Route
  
+ Use withRouter _around_ `connect`

```js
withRouter(connect(mapSTP, mapDTP)(MyComponent));
```

---

### <Redirect>

+ `to` property takes a string or object to redirect route to
  
+ `from` property can only be used within a Switch statement to redirect from one route to another

```html
<Switch>
  <Route path='/error' component={Error} />
  <Route path='/' component={Home} />
  <Redirect to='/error' />
</Switch>
```

[Kahoot](https://play.kahoot.it/#/?quizId=d99216d2-a869-4501-9bbc-21b2b08f5b36)

Note:
1) Triangle
2) Circle - Given we aren't using exact, both the "/" and "/profile" routes will match
3) Triangle - By using exact on the "/" route, now only "/profile" matches
4) Diamond - Switch means the first matching route will render. Since the least specific route was listed first, it will always render
5) Square - Route components pass down match.params as props
