### Thinking Ahead to Job Search

* You will have a TOTAL of 3 projects completed by the time you graduate.

6. Next Steps

---

## Fullstack Project
* Pixel perfect clone - (make it look good)
* Ruby on Rails backend, React/Redux frontend (required)
* Major portfolio piece!!!
* Important learning experience

---
## FSP continued...
* Everyone will have a PA
* Design Docs
* Minimum Viable Product (MVPs)
* Must be a CRUD app (users can create, read, update, and delete info)

Note:

* A minimum viable product is a product with just enough functional core features to be effectively deployed
* In this case we'll be calling each feature of your app an MVP, and so you should consider each feature in this light: First work on it to the point where it is functional, and add additional desired flair or functionality later. This is incredibly important and intended to keep you on track.

	* What websites do you like using?
  * What features are you interested in?
  * Is there significant CRUD?
* Will this pigeonhole me in my job search???
	* No

## Logistics- TAs to PAs 
+ Everyone will be assigned one of the TAs as a project advisor.
+ Your PA will regularly review your progress and work and be there to offer guidance and answer questions for you.
+ Questions and bugs during fullstacks tend to get a lot more difficult though, so it's likely that your PA will not always be available immediately.
+ It's important for you to now start building independence
  - We won't be able to offer technical support after graduation
  - You'll need to consult documentation on your own, use your own API keys, etc.
  - This is more like an actual work environment.
  
Note:
* This is to more closely mimic an actual work environment.
* We won't be 100% available during fullstacks
---

## Logistics - MVP Requirements 

1. Is deployed to Heroku 
2. Allows new account creation, login, and guest/demo login
3. Production README, replacing development README
4. 4 Features (unique to each app)
* Total of 7 MVPs
    * 3 MVPs are the same for everyone: Production README, Deployed on Heroku, frontend and backend auth.
    * 4 MVPs are unique to each app and each represent a feature of the app.
* [MVP Requirements](https://github.com/appacademy/curriculum/blob/master/full-stack-project/proposal/mvp-list.md)

---

## Logistics - Quality Metrics 
1. Pixel Perfect / Looks really good
  * Layout
  * Behavior / Interactions
2. Actively Functional
3. Error/Bug Free (Console)
4. Sufficient Seed Data/Images (see #1)
5. Dead Link Free

Note:
* This is what we expect from each feature
---

## Logistics - Plagiarism 
* We at App Academy take plagiarism very seriously.
* Don't make the mistake - any infraction of this policy will result in
immediate dismissal.

1. Don’t copy: There's a huge
difference from referencing and learning from the projects of your
predecessors, and just blatantly not writing files of code.
2. Attribute
3. If you’re unsure, ask ahead of time.

## Scorecard 

* [scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mpc1eArqplVtNakIcgSFHGGEKbFCiRTnOc7d2QUGwW0/edit#gid=935701382)
* same as JSP

## Git Workflow  
  - Our main branch will always be a clean branch.  It will always have working code.
  - When we start a new feature, we will first start a new branch off of main.  
  - Make all of the changes we want to that feature on the feature branch.  
  - Once the feature branch is ready for review and is working, we will merge it into the main branch, and push the main branch up to github and heroku again.
  - This way we keep a clean main branch, we always have a working app online, we can track our changes through git, and we can stay focused on one feature at a time.

## Recipe for Success - Tips

* Recognize the limitations
* Clean, polished, and functional is top priority
* Do one feature at a time! (required)
* Remember that it’s a learning experience 
* Fully internalize React/Redux before starting project
* Talk to each other / collaborate
* Save CSS nitpicking for after hours
