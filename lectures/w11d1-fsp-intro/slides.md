## Logistics - Plagiarism 

We take plagiarism very seriously. Infractions will result in dismissal from the program.

Follow a few simple rules and you'll be fine:

	1. Don't copy: There's a huge difference between referencing and learning from the projects of your predecessors, and just blatantly copying their work
	2. Attribute
	3. Ask

## Logistics - TAs to PAs 

+ Each of you will be assigned a Project Advisor (PA)
+ Your PA will:
	+ regularly review your progress
  + offer guidance and answer questions
  + help hold you accountable to deadlines
  + encourage independent bug hunting

## Project Completion and Expectations
### What did we mean by "finish as many MVPS as possible?"

- Your progress on this project will directly translate into your readiness and success in the Job Search
- At a minimum you should complete 60% of your FSP by the end of the two weeks
  - A complete and styled; User Auth, Feature 1 and Feature 2
  - Successful hosting of your website
  - A complete Production README

Anything you do not complete will need to be completed before you are approved to start your job search
- You should aim for 100% completion
  - Success in software development is not aligned with minimum expectations
  - Completing 7 MVPs is possible in two weeks. YOU GOT THIS!

Students with an incomplete project (<5 total MVPs completed) may be deferred

* Same one you used for your JSP - no need to create another

## Git Workflow

+ Utilize git and [feature branching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
	- Your `main` branch will always be clean and error free
  - Create a new branch whenever you start working on a new feature
  - Do all your development work on the feature branch and only merge it into the `main` branch when it is functional and complete
  - Push the updated `main` branch
