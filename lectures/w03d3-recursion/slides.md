- Understand what the inductive step is and how to build it
- Know the advantages of memoization 

---

## Lecture Outline

1. How to think about recursion
1. Movie theater example
1. Demos
1. Recursion reasoning tips
1. Kahoot!

---

## What is a recursive function?

* Calls itself ("recurses")
* Solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems
* Has a _**base case**_ â€“ simplest "already solved" condition
* Builds back up incrementally using an _**inductive step**_ (more to)

---

## Inductive Step

How we use the return value of the previous step to determine the current result.

---

# Movie Theater Example

How do you know what row you are in in a dark theater?

---

## Problem Solving Process

1. Understand the problem
1. Identify Base case
1. Write one step up from base case
1. Logic for inductive step
1. Code it out!

## Code Demos!

## The power of Memoization!

---

## Strategy

 1. Simplify the problem
 2. Identify the base case
 3. Write the inductive step

---

## Final Thoughts

- Assume what your last recursive call should return  
and build out your inductive step from there
- Use small examples to visualize things
	- one or 2 steps up from the base case
- Look at how you can reduce the input on each call
	- Arrays and Strings: shorten them
  - Integers: decrease or increase to a base case
- Return the same data type (base case and final)

## Remember

>>> * You can use recursion and iteration _together_
>>> * Each recursive call will return before anything else happens - just like any method call
>>> * Always assume you're getting back the same data type!

## Thanks!

Experiment. Try things. Do it _wrong_. The point isn't to be perfect. It's to _learn_.
