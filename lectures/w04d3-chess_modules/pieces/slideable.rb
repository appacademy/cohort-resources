module Slideable

  # HORIZONTAL_DIRS stores an array of horizontal directions
    # when a piece moves in a given direction, its row and/or its column should increment by some value
    # ex: A piece starts at position [1, 2] and it moves horizontally to the right
      # its position changes to [1,3]
      # the row increases by 0 and the column increases by 1
  HORIZONTAL_DIRS = [
    [:dx, :dy], # left
    [0, 1], # right
    [:dx, :dy], # up (vertical)
    [:dx, :dy]  # down (vertical)
  ].freeze

  # DIAGONAL_DIRS stores an array of diagonal directions
  DIAGONAL_DIRS = [
    [:dx, :dy], # up + left
    [:dx, :dy], # up + right
    [:dx, :dy], # down + left
    [:dx, :dy]  # down + right

    # get the piece's current row and current column

    # in a loop:
      # continually increment the piece's current row and current column to generate a new position
      # stop looping if the new position is invalid (not on the board); the piece can't move in this direction
      # if the new position is empty, the piece can move here, so add the new position to the moves array
      # if the new position is occupied with a piece of the opposite color, the piece can move here (to capture the opposing piece), so add the new position to the moves array
        # but, the piece cannot continue to move past this piece, so stop looping
      # if the new position is occupied with a piece of the same color, stop looping

    # return the final moves array

# Note: you can invoke methods from the piece from within the module methods, and vice versa. It is a two way street!
