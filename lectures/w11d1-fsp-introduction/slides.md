## Logistics - Plagiarism 
* We take plagiarism very seriously
* Infractions will result in dismissal from the program

	1. Don't copy: There's a huge difference between referencing and learning from the projects of your predecessors, and just blatantly copying their work
	2. Attribute
	3. Ask

---

## Logistics - TAs to PAs 
+ Each of you will be assigned a Project Advisor (PA)
+ Your PA will:
	+ regularly review your progress
  + offer guidance and answer questions
  + help hold you accountable to deadlines
  + encourage independent bug hunting

## Logistics - MVPs and Project Completion

2. Allows new account creation, login, and demo login
3. Production README

   - Satisfactory styling
   - Smooth, bug-free navigation
   - Adequate seed data
* Total of 7 MVPs

Students with an incomplete project (<5 total MVPs completed) may be deferred

## Logistics - Project Quality
1. "Pixel Perfect" clone
	- Layout
	- Behavior / Interactions
2. Fully functional
3. Error/Bug free (including the console)
4. Sufficient, appropriate seed data
5. Free of dead links or extranneous content

## Logistics - [Scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mpc1eArqplVtNakIcgSFHGGEKbFCiRTnOc7d2QUGwW0/edit#gid=1764138542)

* Same one you used for your JSP - no need to create another

---

## Git Workflow
+ Utilize git and [feature branching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
	- Your `main` branch will always be clean and error free
  - Create a new branch whenever you start working on a new feature
  - Do all your development work on the feature branch and only merge it into the `main` branch when it is functional and complete
  - Push the updated `main` branch up to Heroku

---
