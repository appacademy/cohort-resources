* Notes on nested and superfluous routes
https://github.com/appacademy/curriculum/blob/master/rails/readings/routing-part-ii.md

* Explain that superfluous routes are unused/uncessary routes or repeated routes that may lead to the same controller action. Here's a general design principle: there should be exactly one URL which maps to the representation of a resource.

* Emphasize that students should not nest their backend routes because it is unncessary
