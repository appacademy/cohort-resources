# Ruby Assessment 2 Practice

You will have **1 hour and 20 minutes** to complete this assessment. This
assessment consists of 3 components:

1. [HackRank](http://hr.gs/645de87a-5b54-4af3-8168-9b453bbfb39d) (password:
   `potato`)
2. [efficient_anagrams](./efficient_anagrams.rb)
3. [smart_stack_project](./smart_stack_project/README.md)

## Scoring and time estimates

| Component           | Maximum Points | Estimated Time (minutes) |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| HackerRank          | 54             | 30                       |
| efficient_anagrams  | 8              | 10                       |
| smart_stack_project | 37             | 40                       |

A detailed breakdown of the point values within each component is available in
the instructions for the component. The maximum number of points for this entire
assessment is **99**. Your final score will be calculated as the percentage of
points awarded over the maximum number of points:

`score = (total_points_awarded / 99) * 100`

The passing score for this assessment is **80**.
