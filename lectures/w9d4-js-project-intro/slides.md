# Why a JS Project?

* Almost every employer uses JavaScript in some form
* An opportunity to extend your JS knowledge and explore some great libraries
* You can make something really pretty with JS/CSS (recruiters love pretty stuff!)
* Supplements your FSP and MERN as another coding example

---

# JS Project Requirements

* No unjustified use of Libraries (No Phaser or jQuery). Do your research and justify your choices. 
* Can be a game, but something original is best 
	* No Tetris, Mario, or any game that was an AA project 
* Can be a data visualization project!(D3)
* Choose something with an appropriate scope (project is due on W10D4)
* Must show off front-end skills -- make it pretty
* Must show off JS skills -- make it interactive

# Backend?

* If you are using an external API, sometimes these APIs are not accessible from a browser (CORS-enabled)
* You will need to set up a small backend to reroute your API calls and serve your project. 
* Backend skeleton is on AAO

# Scorecard 
* Same scorecard as full stack project- just a different tab! 
* Do not make a separate scorecard- just share the same link on InterviewDB
