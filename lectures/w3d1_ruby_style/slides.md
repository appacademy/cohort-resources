## Lecture Norms

---

## Lecture Slides

- All of the lecture slides and code from the demo can be found in the `cohort resources` repo on Github: https://github.com/appacademy/cohort-resources/tree/08-30-2021

---

## Typical Lecture Format

* Learning Objectives of the Day
* Today's Material (2hr ~ 3hrs)
* Kahoot! Quiz

---

## Online Lecture Etiquette

* Keep the chat focused on the material (no side conversations)
* There will be allocated question time - avoid asking questions in the middle of the lecturer presenting
* Keep microphone muted at all times (unless asked to speak)

---

## A Quick Word About Questions

1. How relevant is it to everyone?
2. Will the answer help today?
3. How much space am I taking?
4. Am I just showing off?

---

## Participate!

* Volunteer to answer questions posed by the lecturer
* Don't be afraid of saying the wrong thing

---

## Let's get started

---

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the differences between blocks and procs
- Explain the differences between class and instance methods
- Write Ruby code using proper style and methodologies

---

## Agenda

* Blocks/Procs (Slides + Demo)
* Class/Instance Methods (Slides + Demo)
* Kahoot! 1
* Ruby Style (Slides)
* Kahoot! 2

---

## Blocks & Procs
* **Blocks** - *Code snippets* contained by `{ }` or `do..end` that are passed to methods.
* **Procs** - *Objects* that wrap blocks, and allow us to call/invoke the block.
* Defining a method parameter with an ampersand like `&prc` takes a _block_ passed to the method and converts it into a _proc_ so that it can be called within the method (`prc.call`)
  * A method can only be invoked with one block, therefore there can only be one parameter with an ampersand(`&`)

---

## Blocks & Procs Demo

---

## Instance vs Class methods

---

## Instance methods

* Methods that are accessible to an _instance_ of a class - `self` is set to the instance in the context of the method
* Used to perform operations/procedures relating to the instance and its properties (i.e. instance variables)
* Defined using `def <method_name>` within the class definition

---

## Class methods

* Methods that are accessible to the _class itself_ - `self` is set to the class in the context of the method
* Used to perform operations/procedures relating to the class as a whole and its properties (i.e. class variables)
* Used to perform general operations/procedures that instances may need but that don't relate to their specific properties (i.e. instance variables) 
* **Factory Methods** are special class methods used to create a specific _type_ of instance of that class
* Defined using `def self.<method_name>` within the class definition.

## Ruby Code Style

---

`"Imagine you are writing an email. You are in front of the
computer. You are operating the computer, clicking a mouse and typing
on a keyboard, but the message will be sent to a human over the
internet. So you are working before the computer, but with a human
behind the computer. Most of the tasks we do are for humans."`

Yukihiro Matsumoto, Chief Designer of Ruby

---

### Guidelines

* Style is essential - **follow the style guide!**
* During interviews, poor code style is a dead giveaway that someone lacks experience.
* Good ruby code should **read like English**.

---

### Rules

#### Snake, camel case, screaming snake in Ruby

```ruby
  variable_names = 🐍 "snake_case"
  ClassNames = 🐫 "CamelCase"
  CONSTANTS = 😱 🐍"SCREAMING_SNAKE_AHHHH!"
```

---

#### `{}` > `do .. end` for one lines

```ruby
  [1, 2, 3].each do |el|
    # multiple
    # lines
    # ...
  end

  [1, 2, 3].each { |el| puts el } # single line!
```

---

#### single line `if` / `unless`

```ruby
  if truthy_thing?
    # multiple
    # lines
  end

  puts "truthy!" if truthy_thing? # single line!
```

---

#### 80 character limit for lines

```ruby
rant = "You could write really, really, really long lines in Ruby but that is bad code style should be avoided.  Do not have more than 80 characters on one line."
```

---

### No Code Golf

```ruby
  def digitize(num)
    [].tap { |digs| (num, dig = num.divmod(10); digs.unshift(dig)) until num.zero? }
  end

  def ping_pong_filter(arr)
    arr.tap { |a| a.reject!.with_index { |el, i| i.even? }.reverse! until a.length == 1 }[0]
  end

  def increase_responsiveness?(arr)
    arr.each_cons(3).any? { |a| a.all? { |n| n > 0 } || a.all? { |n| n < 0 } }
  end

  def neighbor_sum(arr)
    [0, arr, 0].flatten.tap { |a| return a.map.with_index { |_, i| a[i - 1] + a[i + 1] if a[i + 1] }[1..-2] }
  end
```

---

#### Interpolation > Concatenation

```ruby
  name = "Markov"

  puts "Why, hello there " + name + ", have a lovely day!"

  puts "Why, hello there #{name}, have a lovely day!"
```

---

#### Use `!` for mutating methods, `?` for boolean methods

```ruby
  "abc".upcase!
  [1, 2, 3].reverse!

  5.even?
  "abc".is_a?(String)
```

---

#### Prefer block parameters over `yield`

More explicit:

```ruby
  def do_the_thing(x, &prc)
      prc.call(x)
  end
```

Less explicit:

```ruby
  def do_the_thing(x)
      yield(x)
  end
```

---

#### Use proper spacing and indentation

```rb
def my_function
system("clear")
puts "Let's do this thing!"
loop do
arr = []
until arr.length == 6
until letter
letter = gets.chomp
if not_valid?(letter)
puts "Wrong."
letter = nil
end
arr << letter
end
end
puts "The result is: #{arr}"
end
```

Find the bug in this code

---

```rb
def my_function
  system("clear")
  puts "Let's do this thing!"
  
  loop do
    arr = []
    until arr.length == 6

      until letter
        letter = gets.chomp
        if not_valid?(letter)
           puts "Wrong."
           letter = nil
        end
      arr << letter
    end
  end
  puts "The result is: #{arr}"
end
```

---

#### No one-letter variable names

Exhibit A:

```rb
def do_something(f, s)
  x = nil

  until x == s
    x = @y.z(f)

    a(x) unless v?(x)
    x = nil
  end

  puts "Congratulations!"
end
```

---

#### No one-letter variable names 2

Exhibit B:

```rb
def do_something(prompt, answer)
  input = nil

  until input == answer
    input = @current_player.guess(prompt)

    unless valid_guess?(input)
      alert_invalid_guess(input) 
      input = nil
    end
  end

  puts "Congratulations!"
end
```

Which one would YOU rather your teammate wrote?

---

### Caveat

* Exception to this is loops.
* But even for loops, good to use more meaningful names.
* Especially when using nested loops.

---

## Recap 1

* Adhere to case conventions for `variable_names`, `ClassNames`, and `CONSTANTS`
* Use `do... end` for multi-line blocks and `{}` for single-line blocks.
* If you can keep an `if` or `unless` statement to one line, do it!
* Try to keep your lines shorter than 80 characters

---

## Recap 2

* Interpolation > Concatenation
* `!` for mutating methods, `?` for boolean methods
* `prc.call` > `yield`
* Use proper spacing and indentation!
* Name your variables so your code reads like English!

Note: These rules will differ by language. Stick to the conventions for that language. Your coworkers will thank you for it.
