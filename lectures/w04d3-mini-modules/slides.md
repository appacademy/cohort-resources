## Piece methods

+ moves -> 2D array of positions a piece can move to
+ move_dirs -> 2D array of directions a piece can move
	+ grow_unblocked_in_dir -> helper method for finding all moves in one direction
+ move_diffs -> 2D array of differences from a position
	+ a diff being one step rather than sliding
