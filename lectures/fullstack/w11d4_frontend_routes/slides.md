# W11D4 Full Stack Frontend Routes

---

## Main Points
  1. Frontend Routes are going to be used to determine what components get rendered.
  
---

## Frontend Routes
+ `/login`
+ `/signup`
+ `/feed` - chirp feed, homepage
+ `/users/:userId` - user profile
+ `/chirps/new` - create a chirp
+ `/chirps/:chirpId` - chirp show
+ `/chirps/:chirpId/edit` - update a chirp

- These are the hash routes that will be visible to the user as they navigate your app.
- Be as semantic as possible
- Add annotations for which component is going to be rendered at each route

## Questions

## Other FSP logistics 

---

### Github Issues
+ Create an issue for each MVP (including details and time estimates)
+ Assign your PA so they can track your progress
+ Your PA will close your issue when you've met the requirements

---

### Tips for the FSP

+ Have a working app at every stage of the project. It might not be a
  "good" app, but it should function.
+ Iterate quickly
  + build small pieces to completion
  + test often: write a method, test a method
+ Complete one feature at a time: Write the full stack for each part of your
  app before moving on to the next piece.
+ DON'T write a complete rails app first and then add React on top.
