# JavaScript Assessment

This assessment aims to evaluate your knowledge of JavaScript's basic
and intermediate features. You will not be tested on HTML Canvas,
jQuery, AJAX, or Underscore templates.

You have **80 minutes**. The specs live in the `spec/` directory. Your
code should go in the `src/` directory in the file provided. Problems
are described in that file. 

**Note**: When writing global functions (i.e. _not_ defined on a prototype),
please use a **function declaration** rather than a function expression, 
otherwise some specs will not work. See example below:

```js
// Function Declaration
function foo() {}

// Function Expression
const foo = function() {};
```

## Running Specs

How to run the specs: open up `SpecRunner.html` in a browser.
