## W11D5 FSP: Normalizing State Shape 

---

## Main Points: 
- Top-level state shape - entities, ui, session, errors
- Proper way to store relational data

---
## Top Level State Shape
```js
{
	entities: {
		users: {},
		posts: {}
	},
	session: {
		currentUser: 1
	},
	ui: {
		modalOpen: true
	},
	errors: {
		userErrors: [],
		sessionErrors: [],
		postErrors: []
	}
}
```
- All relational data nested under entities
- Changes to session, ui,  errors, etc are handled by their own reducers/ slice of state

---
# Style
 - State shape is flat!
 - State's keys are camelCased
 - All keys within the values in the state are accessible in the schema

 - Sample state is rendered with triple backticks, and the language (
 
 ```javascript
 const hello = "world"
 ``` 
 ). This will display the state as a code block instead of a giant line of text

---
## Storing relational data
- Store entities by their ID
- Single source of truth for each entity
	- No duplicated data
  - No nested data
  - State shape should closely resemble schema
- Joins tables get their own slice of state
- Redux docs for normalization tips üëç

## Is this okay? (Example 1)
```js
entities: {
  users: [
    {
      id: 3,
      name: 'Andy',
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      name: 'Rose',
    }
  ],
  posts: [
    {
      id: 10,
      name: 'Post 1',
    },
    {
      id: 11,
      name: 'Post 2',
    }
  ]
}
```
---
# No
---
## Is this okay? (Example 2)
```js
{
entities: {
  users: {
    3: {
      id: 3,
      name: 'Andy',
      authoredPosts: [
        {
          id: 1,
          title: 'post 1',
          authorId: 3
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          title: 'post 2',
          authorId: 3
        }
      ]
      }
  },
  posts: {
    1: {
      id: 1,
      title: 'the title 1',
      authorId: 3
    },
    2: {
      id: 2,
      title: 'post 2',
      authorId: 3
    }
  }
}
}

```
---
# No
---
## What about this? (Example 3)

```js
{
entities: {
  users: {
    3: {
      id: 3,
      name: 'Andy',
      authoredPosts: [1, 2]
      }
  },
  posts: {
    1: {
      id: 1,
      title: 'post 1',
      authorId: 3
    },
    2: {
      id: 2,
      title: 'post 2',
      authorId: 3
    }
  }
}
}
```
---
# YES
---
# Pretty good:
```js
{
entities: {
  users: {
    3: {
      id: 3,
      name: 'Andy',
      }
  },
  posts: {
    1: {
      id: 1,
      title: 'post 1',
      authorId: 3,
    },
    2: {
      id: 2,
      title: 'post 2',
      authorId: 3,
    }
  }
}
}
```

# Joins Tables Get Their Own Slice of State (Frontend vs Backend State)

- Recommended by the [Redux Docs][redux]
- "Any table on the backend should have a slice on the frontend"
- Avoid multiple sources of truth for relational data

[redux]:https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuringreducers/normalizingstateshape

---
```js
{
entities: {
  users: {
    3: {
      id: 3,
      name: 'Andy',
      }
  },
  posts: {
    1: {
      id: 1,
      title: 'post 1',
      authorId: 3,
    },
    2: {
      id: 2,
      title: 'post 2',
      authorId: 3,
    }
  },
  postLikes: {
  	1: {
    	id: 1,
      userId: 3,
      postId: 4
    }
  }
}
}
```

# Summary for Normalizing State
+ Prevents repeated information/objects in our frontend state
+ Makes updating the state simpler and more efficient in our reducers.
+ Can prevent unnecessary re-renders of information in other components.

# Where does this go?
- In the repo for your FSP
- Go to Wiki tab
- Create a main page
- Create a state shape page
- Paste in your markdown

---

## Sample State Demo
- [BlueBird Wiki](https://github.com/appacademy/bluebird/wiki)

---

# Due Dates
* State Shape: W12D1
* TAs will not provide help on full stack projects until the design documents/proposal are finished!

--- 

## Project completion Reminder
- Your progress on this project will directly translate into your readiness and success in the Job Search
- At a minimum you should complete 60% of your FSP by the end of the two weeks
  - A complete and styled; User Auth, Feature 1 and Feature 2
  - Successful hosting of your website
  - A complete Production README
- Anything you do not complete will need to be completed before you are approved to start your job search
- You should aim for 100% completion
  - Success in software development is not aligned with minimum expectations
  - 4 features and all 7 MVPs is possible in two weeks

Students with an incomplete project (<5 total MVPs completed) may be deferred
