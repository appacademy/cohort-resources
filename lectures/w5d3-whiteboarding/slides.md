# Whiteboarding

---
## What is whiteboarding?

* Solving a technical question on a whiteboard (as opposed to an IDE like VS Code)

---

## Volunteer?

Note:
* Write a method that takes in an array and doubles it
  * If they ask for it or need help, an example test case is: doubler([1, 2, 3]) # => [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
* Ask for a volunteer, and tell the students that you'll give them an easy question, and that it's just to go over some fundamentals.
* Explain how interviewers don't care if you know solutions, they want to see how you think and how you work. If you get started without asking any questions, they're going to be wary about hiring you.

## What is an interviewer looking for?

* What is your thought process?
* Are you a good communicator? 
* Can you code?

Note:
* Can you think algorithmically? Can you think about efficiency?
* Are you a good communicator? Are you someone I want to think through a new feature with?
  * Do I need to guess what you're thinking?
* Can you code? Can you code neatly and correctly?
  * It's nice if you can get the right answer but not everything. It's not that interesting to them
    if you've done the problem on leetcode before and know the solution. More interesting if you can
    struggle through a new problem you've never seen. 
  * Had an interview where I was sweating bullets and the interviewer told me himself he just wants to see
    how I think.

## What do we expect from you during these exercises?

* Spend time developing your whiteboard skills
  * Spacing / Organization
* Communicate while coding!
  * This can be harder than it seems 

---

# CREPE

Note:
Clarify the question, come up with a Roadmap, Execute code, Prove that it works, optimize for Efficiency

---

## C - Clarify the question

* Don't make any assumptions, ask the interviewer
* Rephrase the question to confirm your understanding
* Find out what the inputs/test cases are
* Make comments on keywords and test cases above your code

Note:
* This is your chance to start a dialog with the interviewer, a quiet whiteboarding session feels tense and awkward. You've likely already passed a coding challenge to get to this stage, they just want to see if they can work with you.
* Writing keywords and test cases on the board serves as a good reference for when you're writing code later

---

## R - come up with a Roadmap

* Lay out your plan for solving the algorithm
* Use the whiteboard or blank space to write pseudo-code!

Note:
* While you've been going over the question and going over test cases, you should have been mentally coming up with your plan. This part of the interview is a continuation of your conversation.
* Even if you still have to think a bit to come up with a plan, still try and explain some of your thought process. The difference between them asking a question, dead silence, and then you coding on the board is night and day.
* Again, use the whiteboard! On the left side, draw the datatype, use arrows, find any way to visually and verbally explain what you're about to do.
* It's okay to ask for hints! Sometimes interviewers will even give it to you if you're struggling for a bit.

---

## E - Execute code

* Visually separate your pseudo-code/notes from your actual code
* Be sure to proper indentation and formating
* Talk as you go

Note:
* Utilize you space on the whiteboard, separate what you've been writing with your actual code, leave spaces between lines in case you need to correct or add anything. This is not VSCode.
* It's ok to have small silences, but in general it's nice to let them know what you're doing line-by-line.

---

## P - Prove that it works

* Using commented out code, walk through a test case


Note:
* Not much to explain here, I might mention that it could be impressive to bring your own markers to make sure you have two colors and that they have enough ink

---

## E - optimize for Efficiency

* Check your code for time optimization


---

## Pairboarding

* Interviewer
  * What is the applicant's thought process?
  * It's ok to guide and give hints
  * Provide feedback!
* Applicant
  * CREPE
  * Remember that this is practice!


Note:
* Students should be pairboarding as the interviewer/applicant relationship
* Interviewer should be supportive and engaged, but don't do the problem for them
* Remember that this is practice, it's not about being right or wrong. We're all here to level up our skills, one of the ways we compete against CS degrees is our ability to communicate effectively. Being comfortable with whiteboarding, yes, will help with interviewing but it also helps us in our general ability to communicate in different ways.
