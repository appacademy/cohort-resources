# Why a JS Project?

* Almost every employer uses JavaScript in some form

* An opportunity to extend your JS knowledge and explore some great libraries

* You can make something really pretty with JS/CSS (recruiters love pretty stuff!)

* Supplements your FSP and MERN as another coding example


---

# JS Project Requirements

* No unjustified use of Libraries (No Phaser or jQuery). Do your research and justify your choices. 

* Can be a game, but something original is best 
	* No Tetris, Mario, or any game that was an AA project 

* Can be a data visualization project!(D3)

* Choose something with an appropriate scope (project is due on W16D1 at 9am)

* Must show off front-end skills -- make it pretty

* Must show off JS skills -- make it interactive

# Backend?

* If you are using an external API, sometimes these APIs are not accessible from a browser (CORS-enabled)

* You will need to set up a small backend to reroute your API calls and serve your project. 

* Backend skeleton is on AAO

# Scorecard 
* Same scorecard as full stack project- just a different tab! 
* Do not make a separate scorecard- just share the same link on InterviewDB
