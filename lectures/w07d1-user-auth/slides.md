## Once upon a time in Rails land...

- Migrations, Models
- Routes, Controllers
- Views

## Securely Storing Passwords in DB

1. Why can't we store plaintext passwords in the DB?
2. Why can't we store encoded/encrypted passwords in the DB?
3. What is the solution then?

---

## Four Key Principles of Hashing

* **One-way** - given an input, we can easily produce the output but not vice versa
* **Deterministic** - same input produces same output every time
* **Uniform** - reduce the amount of possible **hash collisions**
  * Pigeon-hole problem
* **Sensitive** - a small change to the input results in an entirely different hash

So are we good?

## Rainbow Table Attack!!

![rainbow-table-md5](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zYUkRa4hQ6s/WjzytsTZzeI/AAAAAAAAAkA/GAq8hcC67qwiB0mehMDSpQIs71jZzRvYQCLcBGAs/s640/rainbow_table_attack.PNG)

---

## Salting

* Adds entropy to common passwords by pairing them with a random string (i.e. 
the **salt**) and generating the hash from that
* Makes it computationally unfeasible to brute force hashed password, or use a
rainbow table, even for the most common passwords
* Need to store the salt along with the hash in the DB

---

## BCrypt

+ One-way hashing function
+ Incorporates a `salt` to prevent hash/rainbow table attacks
+ Slower relative to other hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2 (this is good)
+ Adaptive, scales with computational power, resistant to brute-force
+ Verifies if two hashes were created from the same input without needing to reveal them
+ Not exclusive to Ruby or Rails â€“ many languages have implementations
+ Include the `bcrypt` gem in `Gemfile` to use in Ruby project

## User Schema

column name       | data type | details
------------------|-----------|-----------------------
`id `             | integer   | not null, primary key
`username`        | string    | not null, indexed, unique
`password_digest` | string    | not null
`session_token`   | string    | not null, indexed, unique

---

## New Gems

- `better_errors`
  + Different (nicer looking) error page
  + Full stack trace
  + Source line in editor
- `binding_of_caller`
  + Enables extra features in `better_errors`
  + REPL on error page
  + Local and Instance Variable inspection
  + We won't use this on its own (only with `better_errors`)

## 3 Key Auth Functionalities

- Sign up new users
- Login existing users
- Logout existing users

---

### Sign Up

---

## Relevant Routes for Sign Up

- Sign up
  + `get '/users/new', to: 'users#new'`
  + `post '/users', to: 'users#create'`

```rb
#config/routes.rb
resources :users, only: [:new, :create]
```

---

## How do we 'Sign Up' a user?

1. Pass params (`username`, `password`) through a form
2. Create a new instance of a user with these params
3. Try to save the user in the database
    - User needs `password_digest` and `session_token` attributes
4. Login, redirect, show errors, etc.

---

## CODE DEMO 1

## Let's sign up a user

---

## Questions?

---

## That was a lot!

## Let's break for 5 minutes!

---

## Login

---

## Relevant Routes for Login

- Login
  + `get '/session/new', to: 'session#new'`
  + `post '/session', to: 'session#create'`

```rb
#config/routes.rb
# note - singular resource
resource :session, only: [:new, :create] 
```

---

## How do we 'Login' a user?

- Database does not know anything about who is logged in
- The 'logged in' status depends on `cookies`
- The controller modifies our `cookies` using the `session`
- A user is logged in if

```ruby
user.session_token == session[:session_token]
```

---

## What the heck is the `session` thing?

- Hash-like object that we can add key-value pairs to, allowing for a nice interface to manage cookies on our site and allow data to persist across request-response cycles (remember _HTTP is stateless_)
- Created under the hood by `ActionController::Base` for every request that comes in (note that it is *lazily loaded*)
- Sends cookies back down to the browser with each response (browser sends them back up with each request)
- Only available in controllers and views

---

## CODE DEMO 2

## Let's login a user

---

## Questions?

---

## Take a 5 minute break!

---

## Logout

---

## Relevant Routes for Logout

- Logout
  + `delete '/session', to: 'session#destroy'`

```rb
#config/routes.rb
# note - singular resource
resource :session, only: [:destroy] 
```
---

## How do we 'Logout' a user?

Remember, a user is logged in if:
```rb
    user.session_token == session[:session_token]
```
Therefore, we need to:
- reset the user's session token
- nilify session's session token

---

## CODE DEMO 3

## Let's logout a user

---

## Now let's ponder some important questions...

---

## [1/8] Why don't we need to include `password` in the schema if it is one of our params?


---

## [2/8] What is the difference between encryption and hashing?

---

## [3/8] Why is it important that `session_token` be unique? Indexed?

---

## [4/8] Does `password_digest` need to be unique? Why or why not? Should it also be indexed?

---

## [5/8] Why do we need to add `allow_nil: true` to `password` validation?

---

## [6/8] Why do we call `self.save!` in `reset_session_token!`? What would happen if we didn't?

---

## [7/8] Why do we reset the user's session token in the DB instead of setting it to nil on logout?

---

## [8/8] Why do we only have one session (single resource)?

---
