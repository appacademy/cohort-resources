## Learning Goals

* DOM Manipulation
* Events
  * Event Handlers/Listeners
    * Bubbling and Delegation
    * `target` vs `currentTarget`
* Web APIs
  * `Document`, `History`, `Location`
* Vanilla DOM Manipulation <> jQuery
  
---

## What is the DOM?

* The `Document` is any web page loaded in the browser. This `Document` serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is represented by the DOM. 

* A reference to the `Document` object exists as a property on the `Window` (i.e. `window.document`)

* DOM (Document Object Model) - A web API available for HTML, SVG, and XML documents
	* It allows programs to change the document structure, style, and content. 
  * The DOM represents the document using nodes and objects to represent the structure of our document (think family tree).

---

## DOM Manipulation and JavaScript

* DOM manipulation allows us to use plain JavaScript to perform CRUD operations on the objects on our webpage. Any changes are reflected in the display of the document.

* Different browsers have different implementations of the DOM, with varying degrees of conformance to the W3C DOM standard, but every web browser uses some document object model to make web pages accessible via JavaScript.

## Data Types 

* `Node` - Every object located within a document is a node of some kind. 

* `Element` - Refers to an element or a node of type element returned by a member of the DOM API.

* `NodeList`- A nodeList is an array-like collection of nodes and can be accessed through indexing.

* `HTMLCollection` - A HTMLCollection is an array-like collection of elements

---

## DOM Manipulation Methods 

* `.getElementById(idString)` - Returns the HTML element of given Id

* `.getElementsByClassName(classString)` - Returns Collection of HTMLElements with the given class

* `.querySelector(selector)` - Returns first element of given selector

* `.querySelectorAll(selectors)` - Returns NodeList of matches
	+ selectors can be tags(div), classes(.hidden), ids, and combined(h2#TOP > p)

---
## DOM Styling Methods

### Inline
* element.style.property = "value" => inline sets property to given value 				 
    * `div.style.display = "none";`
    * `p.style.fontWeight = "900";`
### Class
* element.classList => return array-like Object of classes for the element

* element.classList.add(class) => adds a class to given element

* element.classList.remove(class) => removes class  

---

## Events and the DOM

* An event can be something the browser does or something a user does.

* Examples:
	* A web page has finished loading
	* An input field was changed
  * A button was clicked
  
* JavaScript code can react to these events via event _handlers_ or _listeners_ installed on DOM elements.

+ [Super quick and painless list of web events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)

---

## Event Listeners

* There are 3 ways to register event handlers for a DOM element.
	* On an event target element using `EventTarget.addEventListener()`*
  * On a HTML attribute `<button onclick="alert('Hello world!')">`
  * DOM element properties `myButton.onclick = function(event){alert('Hello world')}`

---

## When using `.addEventListener` 
* `change`: An HTML element has been changed
* `click`: The user clicks an HTML element
* `mouseover`: The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
* `mouseout`: The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
* `keydown`: The user pushes a keyboard key
* `load`: An object has been loaded.

---

## Directly on an html element 
* `onchange`: An HTML element has been changed
* `onclick`: The user clicks an HTML element
* `onmouseover`: The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
* `onmouseout`: The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
* `onkeydown`: The user pushes a keyboard key
* `onload`: An object has been loaded.

## DOM Manipulation Demo

## Problem

* Let's say that we have a parent element with several child elements
* Let's also say that something needs to happen when each child element is clicked
* You could add a separate event listener to each individual child element, but what if the child elements are frequently added and removed?
* Adding and removing event listeners would be a _nightmare_

* Additionally, event handlers can potentially cause memory leaks and performance degradation ‚Äî the more you have, the greater the risk.

---

## Solution: Bubbling and Event Delegation

* Avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes

* Instead, the event listener is added to a common parent.

* Bubbling Principle: after an event triggers on the deepest
possible element, it then triggers on its parents in nesting order.

* The event listener analyzes bubbled events to find a match on child elements.

### Target vs currentTarget

1. `Event.target`: A reference to the _specific_ object where the event occured. This object "dispatched" the event.


1. `Event.currentTarget`: A reference to the element on which the event handler has been attached as opposed to `event.target` which identifies the element on which the event occurred.

## Web APIs

* Web APIs are APIs for either a web server or a web browser.

* Web APIs are typically only accessible from the application's client-side.

* [MDN's List of WEB APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)

---

## History

* The `window.history` read-only property returns a reference to the `History` object

* The `History` object provides an interface for the browser session history (pages visited in the tab that the current page is loaded in).

* There is no way to clear the session history or to disable the back/forward navigation from your code.

---

## History methods

* Moving backward and forward through the user's history is done using the `window.history.back()` and `window.history.forward()`.

* You can also use the `window.history.go()` method to load a page identified by its relative position to the current page (with the current page being relative index 0).

  * (i.e. `history.go(-4)` goes back 4 pages.)

* You can determine the number of pages in the history stack via `window.history.length`:

---

## Location

* The `window.location` property returns a reference to the `Location` object.

* The `Location` object contains information about the current URL.

---

## Navigating with Location

* To go to a page all of these are equivalent
	* `window.location.assign(url);`
	* `window.location = url;`
	* `window.location.href = url;`
  * `window.document.URL` (READ ONLY)
* ex: `window.location.replace("https://google.com")`

---
## Anchor 

* "#" comes at the end of the url
* it looks for ids with whatever string comes after the "#"
* if it doesn't find any then nothing happens

* if it does then it takes the page and anchors it to that html element

## jQuery?

* **A JS library that abstracts much of the DOM manipulation for us**
  * Rapid Development
    * concise: "write less, do more"
    * Simplifies "complicated" AJAX calls and DOM manipulation
  * Multi-browser cross compatible

* **A solid understanding of Vanilla JS and Dom Manipulation means JQuery may not be necessary. Always ask yourself, ["Do I need JQuery?](https://blog.garstasio.com/you-dont-need-jquery/why-not/) or is Vanilla JS better for this application?"**

## Closing thoughts - Single Page App (SPA)

* A web app that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server.

* The appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions.
