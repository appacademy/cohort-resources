# Demo Instructions:

## Reset Demo
Show what the reset file does to the default browser specific styling. 

Emphasize that different browsers have different styling and that resetting this and doing the styling yourself makes for a better UI.

## Specificity/Selectors Demo
selectors.html
selectors.css
selectors_solutions.css - contains the speceficity scores for each selector

Not much to type out here, just to illustrate some stuff (descendant selectors). After showing briefly, we revisit to show the difference between `p.highlight` and `p .highlight`. (Need to comment this in).

Calculate the specificity score for each selector in the css file. Show precedence of one over another and how equal speceficity selectors overwrite each other. (The one that's further down in the code overwrites the previous) 

## Box Model Demo
box-model.html
box-model.css

This demo will be a good time to introduce students to the Chrome dev tools. Take the time to poke around and show them the tabs they will be working with.

Make sure to highlight the differences of margin and padding. After that, show the difference between the default `box-sizing: content-box` and `box-sizing: border-box`. (Make sure to comment out the code in the html file).
