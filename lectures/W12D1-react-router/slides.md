## Single Page Applications

+ React is popular for single page applications (SPAs) because only required or updated components are rendered.

+ Oftentimes in SPAs, only one HTML is served up from the server unlike multiple page applications (MPAs).
	+ There is no page reload when content on the page changes. 

---

## Frontend Routes !== Backend Routes

+ Using React, only one request is made at the beginning of the session - or upon refresh - to the server to get HTML

+ The root route `/` is the only backend route that serves up HTML

+ Other backend routes from Rails serve as API endpoints to get data from the database, but not to get HTML.

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root to: 'static_pages#root'
end
```

---

## The Illusion of Navigation

+ React renders different components but the url will always be the root path `/`

+ React Router provides a way to create dynamic frontend routes
  + frontend routes mimic the navigation of a multi-page site
  + frontend routes allow us to define UI based on what's in the URL

---

## React Router Basics

+ React Router is the defacto routing library for React

+ Three primary components in React Router:
	+ router `<HashRouter>`
  + route matchers `<Route>` and `<Switch>`
  + navigation `<Link>`, `<NavLink>`, `<Redirect>`

+ All imported from `react-router-dom`

---


## Getting started

+ run `npm install react-router react-router-dom`

+ wrap app in `<HashRouter>` inside of `<Provider>`


---

## <HashRouter>
  
+ `<HashRouter>` Example: "www.mywebsite.com/#/person/john"
  - server will get "www.mywebsite.com/"
  - react router will read "/person/john"

```jsx
// Other imports omitted for brevity
import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

const Root = ({ store }) => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <HashRouter>
      <App />
    </HashRouter>
  </Provider>
);
```

---

## `<Route>`

+ Renders specific components based on URL path
  
+ Renders matched components inclusively

+ When a path does not match any routes, `null` will be rendered
  
```jsx
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
//define routes inside of render or return
  <Route path="/" component={Home} />
  <Route path="/todos" component={TodoIndexContainer} />
  <Route path="/todos/new" component={TodoFormContainer} />
```

---

## Props a `<Route>` Accepts

+ `path`: the path to match against
+ `exact`: ensures the path is an exact match
  + If any path is matched completely - regardless of additional characters in the URL, the component will render
+ `component`: takes a React component
+ `render`: takes an inline function

```jsx
<Route path="/todos" component={TodoIndexContainer} />
<Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
<Route exact path="/" render={() => <h1>Home</h1>} />
```

---
  
## <Switch>

+ Renders only the first matching route
  
+ Beware of ordering!
  
+ Good to have a catch-all ('/') route as the last nested route

```jsx
<Switch>
  <Route path="/todos/new" component={TodoFormContainer}/>
  <Route path="/todos" component={TodoIndexContainer}/>
  <Route path="/" component={Home}/>
</Switch>
```

---
  

## `<Link>`

+ Generates an anchor tag in your HTML document to a specific route

+ `to` property takes in a string representing the path to link to
+ `exact`: ensures the path is an exact match
  + Example - `/users/123` will not match to=`/users` with the exact flag
  
```jsx
<Link to="/todos">All Todos</Link>

// <a href="/todos">All Todos</a> renders to your HTML
```

---

## `<NavLink>`

+ Built on top of `<Link>` with additional props for styling
  
+ Styling attributes are added to an active `<NavLink>` element when current URL matches `to` prop

---

## `<NavLink>` Props

+ `to` and `exact` - same as `<Link>`
+ `activeClassName`: class name for an active `<NavLink>` element
  + `.active` is default class provided
+ `activeStyle`: inline styling to apply to an active `<NavLink>` element

```jsx
<NavLink
  exact
  to="/users"
  activeClassName="selected"
  activeStyle={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}
>Users</NavLink>
```

## Props a `<Route>` Passes to its `component`

+ `match` - an object with the following properties: `params`, `isExact`, `path`, `url`

+ `location` - immutable object that represents url's current state

+ `history` - mutable object that keeps track of our hash routes
  + Includes methods such as: `push`, `replace`

+ Route props are accessible via ownProps

---

## ownProps Review

+ In Redux, containers are themselves components, so they receive props from parent components
 + These props are referred to as `ownProps`
  
+ Their props are passed as an argument to `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`
  
+ `ownProps` will *also* be passed down to the connected component

---

## match.params

+ ownProps can be used to access route props in our Redux containers

+ Example - In `mapStateToProps`, use `match.params` to access wildcards (i.e. `:id` ) in our url

```js
// TodoShowContainer 
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  todo: state.todos[ownProps.match.params.id]
});

```

## withRouter

+ *function* available from React Router

+ Provides Router props (match, location, history) to components NOT rendered by a <Route>
  
+ Use withRouter _around_ `connect`

```js
withRouter(connect(mapSTP, mapDTP)(MyComponent));
```

---

## `<Redirect>`

+ `to` property takes a string or object to redirect route to
  
+ `from` property can only be used within a Switch statement to redirect from one route to another

```jsx
<Switch>
  <Route path='/error' component={Error} />
  <Route path='/' component={Home} />
  <Redirect to='/error' />
</Switch>
```
