# Assessment01 Instructions

* You will have 45min for this assessment.
    * Do not worry if you do not complete all the assessment; do the
      best you can.
* Instructions for each problem are written inside the spec files (in
  the `spec` directory).
* Run the specs as you solve the assessment. Try to get as many specs
  to pass as you can.
    * To run one specific spec, add `:line_number` at the end.  For example, `bundle exec rspec spec/assessment01_spec.rb:22`
    * To run all the specs, run `bundle exec rspec spec/assessment01_spec.rb` in the
      console.
    * Look at the title of the spec to see why it failed; you can also
      look at the spec code for more information.
* You're graded based on the number of passing specs; so make sure
  they pass. If you get stuck on a problem, move on to the next.
* Please ask your TAs any questions. If you get stuck or don't know
  why something is failing; ask. TAs will let you know whether they
  can answer your question, so ask anything.
    * Do not use the internet or prior notes.
* To submit:
    * Rename the directory `"#{first_name}_#{last_name}"`.
    * ZIP it
      * Use `.zip`; no boutique formats please :-)
    * Upload to progress tracker.
