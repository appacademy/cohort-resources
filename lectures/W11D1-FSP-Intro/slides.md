## Logistics - Plagiarism 
* We at App Academy take plagiarism very seriously.
* Don't make the mistake - any infraction of this policy will result in
immediate dismissal.

1. Don’t copy: There's a huge
difference from referencing and learning from the projects of your
predecessors, and just blatantly not writing files of code.
2. Attribute
3. If you’re unsure, ask ahead of time.

## Logistics - TAs to PMs 
+ Everyone is going to be assigned one of the TAs as a project manager.  
+ Your PM will be like your supervisor for your fullstack.
  - This is to more closely mimic an actual work environment.
+ Your PM will regularly review your progress and work and be there to offer guidance and answer questions for you.  
+ Your PM will typically be who answers your questions.
+ Questions and bugs during fullstacks tend to get a lot more difficult though, so it's likely that your PM will not always be available immediately.
+ It's important for you to now start building independence
  - We won't be 100% available during fullstacks
  - We won't be able to offer technical support after graduation
  - You'll need to consult documentation on your own, use your own API keys, etc.
  - This is more like an actual work environment.

## Git Workflow
+ We work feature to feature using git and feature branching.  
  - Our main branch will always be a clean branch.  It will always have working code, even if that code doesn't do anything.
  - When we start a new feature, we will first start a new branch off of main.  
  - We will leave main untouched, and make all of the changes we want to our code on the feature branch.  
  - Once the feature branch is ready for review and is working, we will merge it into the main branch, and push the main branch up to heroku again.
  - This way we keep a clean main branch, we always have a working app online, we can track our changes through git, and we can stay focused on one feature at a time.
