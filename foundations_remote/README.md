# Workflow after finishing projects
## Unless otherwise told so, this will be the workflow after you have finished all of the projects for the day.
1. Go over any questions or uncertainties you may have had while you worked with your partner
2. Go through the solutions with your partner. Keep in mind that some of the solutions will be weird and may not be something you have ever seen. It's ok that you havent seen things done a certain way. You can always learn something new. Also, don't spend too much time trying to understand the solutions.  Try your best to come up with your own. 
3. Get started on the homework and readings for tomorrow
4. Go to cohort resources and work on the leetcode problems located in the master branch at whiteboarding/leetcode_problems
