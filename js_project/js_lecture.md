---

# Schedule

* W15D1 (Monday): Proposal due

* W16D1 (Monday): Project due

# Why a JS Project?

* Almost every employer uses JavaScript in some form

* An opportunity to extend your JS knowledge and explore some great libraries

* You can make something really pretty with JS/CSS (recruiters love pretty stuff!)

* Supplements your FSP and MERN as another coding example

---

# JS Project Requirements

* No unjustified use of Libraries (No Phaser or jQuery). Do your research and justify your choices. 

* Can be a game, but something original is best

* Can be a data visualization project!

* Choose something with an appropriate scope (project is due on W16D1 at 9am)

* Must show off front-end skills -- make it pretty

* Must show off JS skills -- make it interactive

# Backend?

* If you are using an external API, sometimes these APIs are not accessible from a browser (CORS-enabled)

* You will need to set up a small backend to reroute your API calls and serve your project. 

* Backend skeleton is on AAO

# Top Tips

* Include a mute button for sound/music

* No impossible games

* Provide clear instructions

* Pick a nice font

* Data that can be understood! 

* Production ReadMe!

Note: Data needs to be labeled clearly so people can understand what you are showing them
